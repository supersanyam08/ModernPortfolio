Build me a modern, dynamic portfolio website using React + Tailwind + Framer Motion.  
It should have the following sections and features:

1. Hero Section  
- Fullscreen gradient background with moving particles.  
- Name: "Sanyam Agarwal".  
- One-line tagline: "Electronics Engineer | Data, Product & Finance Enthusiast".  
- Two buttons: "Download CV" (links to /Sanyam_Agarwal_CV.pdf) and "Contact".  
- Include a 3D tilt card on the right side showing a featured project.  
- Use Framer Motion entrance animations for text and buttons.

2. About Section  
- A short bio describing education (Electronics Engineering graduate), internships (IIT Roorkee – PCB project, Procol – SaaS growth), and skills (Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, HubSpot).  
- A sidebar list with quick facts: education, internships, languages (English + French learner), open to roles (Analyst/Product/Data).

3. Projects Grid  
- Responsive 3-column grid (1 column on mobile).  
- Each project card shows: tag, title, description, and tech stack.  
- Hover lift animation using Framer Motion.  
- Example projects:  
  a) Soil & Weather Monitoring PCB (Hardware/IoT)  
  b) Smart Inventory Management (Capstone project)  
  c) Procol SaaS Growth (Business role)

4. Timeline Section  
- Vertical timeline for education + work.  
- Animate items into view on scroll.

- On the right side, show my email (sanyam@example.com), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/sanyam), and hobbies (Football, Chess, Films, Formula 1).  

7. Footer  
- Simple centered footer with © {year} Sanyam Agarwal.  
- Mention “Built with React · Framer Motion · Tailwind”.

8. SEO + Performance (in index.html)  
- Add meta tags (title, description, author).  
- Add Open Graph + Twitter card tags.  
- Add JSON-LD schema for Person with my details.  
- Preload fonts, lazy-load images.

Requirements:  
- Use Tailwind for layout & styling.  
- Use Framer Motion for animations.  
- Use react-tsparticles for particle background.  
- Make it fully responsive (mobile → desktop).  
- Accessible: labels, aria attributes, good contrast.
